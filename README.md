# Izumi
**Izumi is a tabata timer that doesn't suck**. It's named after [Izumi Tabata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Izumi_Tabata), inventor of the Tabata technique. [Don't know what a Tabata timer is?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-intensity_interval_training#Tabata_regimen)

Izumi is built using React, Redux, React-Router, CSS Modules, bootstrapped with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), and deployed using [Netlify](netlify.com).
